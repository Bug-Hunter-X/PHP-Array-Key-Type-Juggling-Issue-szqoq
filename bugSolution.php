The most reliable solution is to enforce consistent key types throughout your code. If you're using numeric keys, ensure they're always integers. If you need string keys, use strings consistently.

Here's a modified version that avoids type juggling:

```php
$data = [];
$data["1"] = "one"; //String Key
$data[2] = "two"; //Numeric Key

echo count($data); // Outputs 2
foreach ($data as $key => $value) {
    echo "Key: " . $key . ", Value: " . $value . "\n";
}
```

Alternatively, if you need to handle both numeric and string keys meaningfully, you might employ stricter type checking or data validation techniques during input processing.
